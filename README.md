## FreeHealth Ansible playbooks

Collection of Ansible playbooks to provision GNU/Linux virtual machines for testing or deployment.

Specific instructions for each playbook are inside the corresponding folders.

### ubuntu
This playbook allows you to provision a VM running a minimal server install of Ubuntu 16.04, 17.04 or 17.10 in order to obtain a ready to use LXDE desktop environment with the nightly or stable freehealth packages already installed.

VMs can be built in a few minutes with Packer and Vagrant: see our packer-templates git repository.

With a Linux box and a good internet connection, you can go from 0 to a preconfigured Ubuntu with MariaDB server and FreeHealth packages in less than 5 minutes and 4 terminal commands.
